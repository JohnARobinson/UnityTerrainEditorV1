# UnityTerrainEditorV1
Tile Based Unity Terrain Editor(Obsolete)

Base code for Unity based game idea's initial feature development of modular tile terrain system. Running into difficulties with shader code when it comes to merging textures between tiles.

Difficulties choosing between large mesh with submeshes or indivdual meshes for each tile. This project used one large single mesh and was attempting to create submeshes for each tile. Ran into difficulties both with memory load and texture merging.

Abandoned this project so far as was mesh generation system did not work with dynamic mesh texture merging. Related game idea's are preserved just code progress thus far on this project scrapped 

Included functions so far
-functional menu system
-dynamic mesh tile terrain system with interface to change y value
-dynamic mesh tile texture system: in progress - difficulties with including large number of submeshes for each texture type, along with texture merging.
-mesh save and load menu/system: in progress
